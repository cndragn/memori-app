# Memori
Memori is a spaced repetition digital flashcard app to improve Spanish vocabulary.  Unlike other spaced repetition apps, you have to type in your answer, so not only do you need to get the word correct you also need to know how to spell it.

The algorithm used to determine how often a vocabulary word appears for study is based on a description of the Leitner method for spaced repetition.
